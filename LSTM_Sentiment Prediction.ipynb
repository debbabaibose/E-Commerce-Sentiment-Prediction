    "In this notebook we focused on sentiment analysis using Deep Neural Network. There are mainly two types of Neural Network -\n",
    "1. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "2. Recurrent Neural Neural Network (RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN is mainly used in image classification. Whereas, RNN is mainly used in time series and sequence data. We have already used a number of different Machine Learning Algorithms which gave us an acuracy in the range of 0.80.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RNN, the output of one layer serves as the input of the next layer. Hence, it works better than any machine learning model. But, the output of first layer have lower impact on the final output than the impact of the output of second last layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this situation, we use LSTM to overcome this drawback as LSTM architeture has an extra cell state which is not present in RNN.\n",
